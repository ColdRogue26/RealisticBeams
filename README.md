Beam turrets, M and L alike now have x6 range but do x6 less damage and their rotation speed also is x6 lower. Faction differences are accounted for.

It felt a bit off to me, that beams were so short ranged and yet did so much damage (relatively speaking, as it's light!).
Mod includes all DLC beam turrets, but DLCs are optional. Mod compatibility not tested.
